      "bodyText": "The African continent is a “blind spot” for coverage of the humanitarian crises that are being fuelled by the climate emergency, according to a new analysis [pdf]. Madagascar’s chronic food crisis, where 2.6 million people were affected by drought in 2019, came top of the list of 10 of the most under-reported crises last year, Care International’s annual survey found. Others included Zambia, a country on the frontline of the climate emergency, with 2.3 million struggling to eat due to drought, and Kenya, which received only 20% of expected rainfall in 2019, and where 1.1 million people were hungry amid both floods and drought. Last year, climate activism led by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg dominated headlines in the northern hemisphere, but the suffering of millions of people in food poverty caused by global heating in the south was not being covered, according to the research. Nine of the 10 countries in which at least one million people were affected by natural or man-made disasters to receive the least media attention were in Africa, where temperatures are rising at twice the global average, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “We’re seeing increasing linkages between the effects of man-made climate change and the longevity and complexity of humanitarian crises,” said Sally Austin, international head of emergency operations at Care. “From Madagascar to Lake Chad to North Korea, the majority of crises ranked in our report are partly a consequence of declining natural resources, increasing extreme weather events and global warming more broadly.” “What the report does is to highlight those 10 countries which received the least amount of media coverage. Is this because people aren’t interested in reading about it? Should we be thinking: ‘Is this good enough?’” North Korea and Eritrea, both highly secretive states where press freedom is limited and reporting is restricted, were also on the list. “The increased public attention for the global climate crisis is encouraging, but we must ensure that the conversation is not limited to the global north and much-needed transformations there,” Austin said. The countries with most media coverage of humanitarian crisis were Syria and Yemen and the Democratic Republic of Congo, all countries with ongoing conflict. For its fourth annual survey, Care used the Meltwater group to monitor and analyse 2.4 million online sources, in English, French, German, Spanish and Arabic. A list of 40 humanitarian crises in which a million people were affected was monitored from January 2019 until 15 November. The other countries included the Central African Republic, which was ranked second after Madagascar, due to ongoing conflict; Burundi, where instability is causing displacement and 1.7 million people are hungry; and Burkina Faso, where a quarter of the population, 5.2 million, are affected by escalation of violence. Ethiopia, one of the world’s most drought-prone countries, where 7.9 million people are suffering a cycle of disaster, hunger and displacement due to the reportedly shrinking Lake Chad was also on the list. The report found a correlation between media coverage and funding received: three of the 10 most under-reported crises in the report are also on the UN’s 2019 list of most underfunded emergencies.",

          "bodyTextSummary": "The African continent is a “blind spot” for coverage of the humanitarian crises that are being fuelled by the climate emergency, according to a new analysis [pdf]. Madagascar’s chronic food crisis, where 2.6 million people were affected by drought in 2019, came top of the list of 10 of the most under-reported crises last year, Care International’s annual survey found. Others included Zambia, a country on the frontline of the climate emergency, with 2.3 million struggling to eat due to drought, and Kenya, which received only 20% of expected rainfall in 2019, and where 1.1 million people were hungry amid both floods and drought. Last year, climate activism led by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg dominated headlines in the northern hemisphere, but the suffering of millions of people in food poverty caused by global heating in the south was not being covered, according to the research. Nine of the 10 countries in which at least one million people were affected by natural or man-made disasters to receive the least media attention were in Africa, where temperatures are rising at twice the global average, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “We’re seeing increasing linkages between the effects of man-made climate change and the longevity and complexity of humanitarian crises,” said Sally Austin, international head of emergency operations at Care. “From Madagascar to Lake Chad to North Korea, the majority of crises ranked in our report are partly a consequence of declining natural resources, increasing extreme weather events and global warming more broadly.” “What the report does is to highlight those 10 countries which received the least amount of media coverage. Is this because people aren’t interested in reading about it? Should we be thinking: ‘Is this good enough?’” North Korea and Eritrea, both highly secretive states where press freedom is limited and reporting is restricted, were also on the list. “The increased public attention for the global climate crisis is encouraging, but we must ensure that the conversation is not limited to the global north and much-needed transformations there,” Austin said. The countries with most media coverage of humanitarian crisis were Syria and Yemen and the Democratic Republic of Congo, all countries with ongoing conflict. For its fourth annual survey, Care used the Meltwater group to monitor and analyse 2.4 million online sources, in English, French, German, Spanish and Arabic. A list of 40 humanitarian crises in which a million people were affected was monitored from January 2019 until 15 November.\nThe other countries included the Central African Republic, which was ranked second after Madagascar, due to ongoing conflict; Burundi, where instability is causing displacement and 1.7 million people are hungry; and Burkina Faso, where a quarter of the population, 5.2 million, are affected by escalation of violence. Ethiopia, one of the world’s most drought-prone countries, where 7.9 million people are suffering a cycle of disaster, hunger and displacement due to the reportedly shrinking Lake Chad was also on the list. The report found a correlation between media coverage and funding received: three of the 10 most under-reported crises in the report are also on the UN’s 2019 list of most underfunded emergencies.",

In 2003, heavy rainfall caused the Senegal river to rise rapidly, putting Saint-Louis at risk of flooding. As a quick fix, local government dug a four-metre-wide breach, or canal, cutting through the Langue de Barbarie. The effect has been the opposite of the one intended. Although at first the river level dropped, the breach quickly started to expand. It is now 6km wide and has cut off part of the peninsula, turning it into an island – and flooding Doun Baba Dieye.</p> <p>It has also upset the delicate balance of the local ecosystem. The canal brought seawater into the river, increasing its salinity level. This has affected the population of rare bird species and river fish – forcing fishermen to venture into Mauritanian waters, which is dangerous and illegal – as well as wiping out the coconut trees and mangroves that once protected the shores. Local crops, already destabilised by irregular rainy seasons and sand storms, were further damaged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b752911739e85c384185fae1a5a9d6eb0c9f366\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b752911739e85c384185fae1a5a9d6eb0c9f366/0_0_4000_2666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beach  at Guet N'dar village.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inhabitants of the Langue de Barbarie have been fishing for centuries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sylvain Cherkaoui/Cosmos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ameth, along with more than 800 former inhabitants of Doun Baba Dieye, are among the victims forced to move away from the peninsula without any support from the state. “We are fishermen, we know the ocean, so we left at the good moment – and nobody got hurt,” says Ameth, before correcting himself: “We were fishermen.” Since his community was dispersed, Ameth’s fishing boat, a pirogue, remains largely unused: “We live too far from the ocean now.

Everything which was important to me happened here,” says Ameth, the former village chief.</p> \n<p>Doun Baba Dieye is in the southern part of Langue de Barbarie, a thin, sandy strip of land protecting Saint-Louis, former colonial capital of Senegal, from the ocean. Saint-Louis, a city of 230,000 and a Unesco world heritage site, is nestled between the mouth of the Senegal river and the Atlantic.</p> \n<p>The French chose Saint-Louis as the capital because of its strategic location, which allowed the city to flourish in colonial times. But today the “Venice of Africa” is being eaten up by the rising waters. Crossing the Faidherbe bridge, which connects the colourful city centre to the mainland, it seems as if you can almost touch the water. This state of a permanent flood alert has become the city’s new normal.</p> \n<p>In Saint-Louis, the consequences of climate crisis are tangible: thousands of people uprooted; houses destroyed; hundreds of children attending classes in the evening instead of in the morning because their school has been swept into the ocean. The World Bank, which recently allotted €24m (£20m) to combat the effects of climate change in Saint-Louis, estimates that <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/06/07/senegal-world-bank-supports-10000-people-affected-by-climate-change\">10,000 people</a> in the city are either already displaced or live within 20 metres of the waterline, the high-risk zone.</p> \n<p>And this is just the beginning. <a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/537811468305337766/pdf/837830WP0P12030Box0382112B00PUBLIC0.pdf\">According to a study</a> commissioned by the Senegalese government, 80% of Saint-Louis territory will be at risk of flooding by 2080, and 150,000 people will have to relocate. Most of west Africa’s coastal cities, home to 105 million people, face a similar threat.</p>"

In 2003, heavy rainfall caused the Senegal river to rise rapidly, putting Saint-Louis at risk of flooding. As a quick fix, local government dug a four-metre-wide breach, or canal, cutting through the Langue de Barbarie. The effect has been the opposite of the one intended. Although at first the river level dropped, the breach quickly started to expand. It is now 6km wide and has cut off part of the peninsula, turning it into an island – and flooding Doun Baba Dieye.</p> \n<p>It has also upset the delicate balance of the local ecosystem. The canal brought seawater into the river, increasing its salinity level. This has affected the population of rare bird species and river fish – forcing fishermen to venture into Mauritanian waters, which is dangerous and illegal – as well as wiping out the coconut trees and mangroves that once protected the shores. Local crops, already destabilised by irregular rainy seasons and sand storms, were further damaged.</p>"

      "bodyText": "The bus company Greyhound Australia has ruled out any extension of work on the controversial Adani coal project after a backlash from climate change campaigners. On Sunday the SchoolStrike4Climate group launched a campaign to boycott travel with the company until it publicly ruled out working on the mine. Guardian Australia revealed last week that Greyhound had written to staff warning they could be caught “in the crossfire” of anti-Adani campaigners after the company took a three-month contract at the coal project, with an option to extend. The Indian-owned Adani mine and railway project is the first to begin work to extract the vast coal reserves of Queensland’s Galilee basin. Greyhound is providing transport to workers for the construction company BMD, which is building the railway to take the coal to Adani’s Abbot Point port. In a statement, Greyhound Australia said it had “received numerous messages, emails and phone calls from people expressing their thoughts both for and against the Carmichael Rail Network and Adani Carmichael project”. It said: “Following considered deliberation, and in the best interests of our staff, customers, and partners, Greyhound Australia has decided to not enter into a contractual agreement with BMD to service construction of the Carmichael Rail Network beyond our preliminary 31 March 2020 commitment.” The company declined to comment further. Within hours of Guardian Australia’s report on the contract, the conservation group Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation announced it had terminated a partnership with Greyhound. Greyhound’s chief executive, Alex de Waal, also resigned as chairman of the foundation. Varsha Yajman, a spokesperson for SchoolStrike4Climate, said the group had launched a campaign to boycott Greyhound buses on Sunday. “We thank Greyhound for not throwing young people under a bus by continuing to help Adani build their climate-wrecking coalmine,” she said. After a summer of “bushfires and heatwaves”, she said, Greyhound’s decision had given her hope. “It shows that we can push companies to be part of the solution to climate change and consider the impact of their actions. “Thanks to Greyhound listening to young people, students can now still go to school camps and on excursions by Greyhound buses.” The climate activist group Galilee Blockade told Guardian Australia it had now cancelled a planned protest targeting Greyhound Australia at Brisbane’s Roma Street travel interchange on Wednesday. Ben Pennings, spokesman for Galilee Blockade, said: “Greyhound took a stupid risk but quickly saw sense. Most Australians don’t want the Adani mine and every single company with a retail brand has listened to their customers and dumped Adani. “We’re already experiencing climate chaos and corporations simply have to take heed of an angry public increasingly willing to risk legal sanction for a liveable climate.” In January the German technology company Siemens said it would honour its Adani contract after it reviewed a reported $30m contract with the project. The engineering firm GHD ended a 10-year association with Adani in December after that company was also targeted by campaigners. Julien Vincent, the executive director of Market Forces, a group that tracks the relationships between corporations and fossil fuel industries, told Guardian Australia: “As Greyhound have discovered, and Siemens are in the middle of discovering, Adani’s climate-wrecking mine is a surefire way to destroy your reputation. “Now we need the likes of Siemens to realise what an appalling and ill-informed decision they have made to work on Carmichael and also pull the pin on their relationship with Adani.” A BMD spokesperson said in a statement: “Our contracts with clients and subcontractors are commercial in confidence and, as such, we do not disclose them publicly.”",

          "bodyTextSummary": "The bus company Greyhound Australia has ruled out any extension of work on the controversial Adani coal project after a backlash from climate change campaigners. On Sunday the SchoolStrike4Climate group launched a campaign to boycott travel with the company until it publicly ruled out working on the mine. Guardian Australia revealed last week that Greyhound had written to staff warning they could be caught “in the crossfire” of anti-Adani campaigners after the company took a three-month contract at the coal project, with an option to extend.\nThe Indian-owned Adani mine and railway project is the first to begin work to extract the vast coal reserves of Queensland’s Galilee basin. Greyhound is providing transport to workers for the construction company BMD, which is building the railway to take the coal to Adani’s Abbot Point port. In a statement, Greyhound Australia said it had “received numerous messages, emails and phone calls from people expressing their thoughts both for and against the Carmichael Rail Network and Adani Carmichael project”. It said: “Following considered deliberation, and in the best interests of our staff, customers, and partners, Greyhound Australia has decided to not enter into a contractual agreement with BMD to service construction of the Carmichael Rail Network beyond our preliminary 31 March 2020 commitment.” The company declined to comment further. Within hours of Guardian Australia’s report on the contract, the conservation group Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation announced it had terminated a partnership with Greyhound. Greyhound’s chief executive, Alex de Waal, also resigned as chairman of the foundation.\nVarsha Yajman, a spokesperson for SchoolStrike4Climate, said the group had launched a campaign to boycott Greyhound buses on Sunday. “We thank Greyhound for not throwing young people under a bus by continuing to help Adani build their climate-wrecking coalmine,” she said. After a summer of “bushfires and heatwaves”, she said, Greyhound’s decision had given her hope. “It shows that we can push companies to be part of the solution to climate change and consider the impact of their actions. “Thanks to Greyhound listening to young people, students can now still go to school camps and on excursions by Greyhound buses.” The climate activist group Galilee Blockade told Guardian Australia it had now cancelled a planned protest targeting Greyhound Australia at Brisbane’s Roma Street travel interchange on Wednesday. Ben Pennings, spokesman for Galilee Blockade, said: “Greyhound took a stupid risk but quickly saw sense. Most Australians don’t want the Adani mine and every single company with a retail brand has listened to their customers and dumped Adani.\n“We’re already experiencing climate chaos and corporations simply have to take heed of an angry public increasingly willing to risk legal sanction for a liveable climate.” In January the German technology company Siemens said it would honour its Adani contract after it reviewed a reported $30m contract with the project. The engineering firm GHD ended a 10-year association with Adani in December after that company was also targeted by campaigners. Julien Vincent, the executive director of Market Forces, a group that tracks the relationships between corporations and fossil fuel industries, told Guardian Australia: “As Greyhound have discovered, and Siemens are in the middle of discovering, Adani’s climate-wrecking mine is a surefire way to destroy your reputation. “Now we need the likes of Siemens to realise what an appalling and ill-informed decision they have made to work on Carmichael and also pull the pin on their relationship with Adani.” A BMD spokesperson said in a statement: “Our contracts with clients and subcontractors are commercial in confidence and, as such, we do not disclose them publicly.”",

These times are hard for us first peoples, so often we are ignored.</p> \n<p>People all over the world are watching as we see what happens when you break lore on fire country. I always seek to acknowledge country and serve her lore.</p> \n<p>Country is our mother, she provides everything. Our energy, protection, air, water, food, shelter, identity, cultural, spirit and so much more. It is important to respect country and give more then you take. It is our custom to share and be humble in our offerings to country. If we break lore, we lose our way and end up here like today.</p> \n<p>A world on fire at the micro and the macro.

We need everyone to remember that feeling of connection and what it felt like to have it ripped away. I believe everyone has the opportunity to remember, if they decolonise their mind and set a path for a better way.</p> \n<p>This way is the old way – it is custodianship, it is following your own path, guided by country.</p> \n<p>Our ancestors managed this landscape for millennia and fire was one of our principle management tools. Through colonisation we have seen a rapid decline in our practices and, equally, a rapid decline in the values associated with this country.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68c4b766c9055261223b0e1086fbff563ae39d35\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68c4b766c9055261223b0e1086fbff563ae39d35/0_0_472_629/375.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Costello\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Costello</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There are many culturally significant species and places that are under threat. It is really important that we establish appropriate cultural protocols and practices to be able to manage them, through local cultural authority and custodianship. An example is koalas — we call them <em>budabe</em> or <em>burbi</em> in our language. They are a really important dreaming story and totem for our country and many other communities.</p> \n<p>It is really important that we understand the diversity of the responsibility that people take on and our role to support and protect them and remember, <em>Budabe nga waybar jagun</em> (Koala belong to fire country).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d0ca4202-d1e8-42b2-933b-f3b497a58274\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/us02Wr4KQ-A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When we talk about cultural fire, we are referring to the type of fire that is right for that land. As you walk through different landscapes the culture changes because the plants and animals, and the kinship of the land shifts. Fire is a critical part of managing country.</p> \n<p>The problem is that we have seen an absence of Aboriginal cultural fire in the landscape and hazard reduction, no fire and wildfires have replaced it.</p> \n<p>What we are not seeing is cultural fire for country and the right fire for country. The right fire for koala country is maintaining the health of the ecosystem. That includes protecting the canopy where the koalas live. Regenerating the tree that they eat.</p> \n<p>When you practise fire the right way, it helps to reduce or stop the wildfires. They will still come but are not as bad as the wildfires we are seeing. If you burn the right way you will also get the next generations of food, habitat and trees. Fires are a critical part of koala country.</p> \n<p>There is no doubt that climate change is making these fires worse.</p> \n<p>No matter how we manage it, there would be a lot of fire in the landscape because there is a drying process and we are dealing with the effects of climate change. Our people managed the landscapes through changing climates for millennia but the degree of climate change we are seeing now is unprecedented.</p> \n<p>Yet we can apply cultural knowledge and lore to this problem too. The knowledge is based on reading country – seasonal indicators and cues, and being able to adapt to the change and transition.</p> \n<p>We are not talking about removing wildfire from the landscape. Wildfire is not a good term for me. A lot of the unplanned fires that happen in a landscape are lightning strikes which have their place in our lore.</p> \n<p>If this country awakens to the need for a cultural fire regime – a mosaic across tenure, across the landscape, that actually has successional burning, every year, we are out there for months and months, young and old people out there burning country, walking their pathways, learning their stories, managing that land – when these fires happen, and they are going to keep happening, the behaviour of the fire will be far different to what we are witnessing now.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/19/right-fire-for-right-future-how-cultural-burning-can-protect-australia-from-catastrophic-blazes\">Right fire for right future: how cultural burning can protect Australia from catastrophic blazes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I would like to acknowledge all the people that helped shape my journey – too many to list here – but I would like to particularly thank my family and community for supporting me on this journey.</p> \n<p>My partner, Layla, kids, Jali and Araluen, support me to live this journey every day.

      "bodyText": "We live in fire country as taught through fire lore, this is how I understand what is happening across country. These times are hard for us first peoples, so often we are ignored. People all over the world are watching as we see what happens when you break lore on fire country. I always seek to acknowledge country and serve her lore. Country is our mother, she provides everything. Our energy, protection, air, water, food, shelter, identity, cultural, spirit and so much more. It is important to respect country and give more then you take. It is our custom to share and be humble in our offerings to country. If we break lore, we lose our way and end up here like today. A world on fire at the micro and the macro. These fires driven by mismanagement of country and climate change are a reflection of the impacts of colonisation on first peoples all over the world. Every human has an ancestry that goes back to a holistic connection to the land. We need everyone to remember that feeling of connection and what it felt like to have it ripped away. I believe everyone has the opportunity to remember, if they decolonise their mind and set a path for a better way. This way is the old way – it is custodianship, it is following your own path, guided by country. Our ancestors managed this landscape for millennia and fire was one of our principle management tools. Through colonisation we have seen a rapid decline in our practices and, equally, a rapid decline in the values associated with this country. There are many culturally significant species and places that are under threat. It is really important that we establish appropriate cultural protocols and practices to be able to manage them, through local cultural authority and custodianship. An example is koalas — we call them budabe or burbi in our language. They are a really important dreaming story and totem for our country and many other communities. It is really important that we understand the diversity of the responsibility that people take on and our role to support and protect them and remember, Budabe nga waybar jagun (Koala belong to fire country). When we talk about cultural fire, we are referring to the type of fire that is right for that land. As you walk through different landscapes the culture changes because the plants and animals, and the kinship of the land shifts. Fire is a critical part of managing country. The problem is that we have seen an absence of Aboriginal cultural fire in the landscape and hazard reduction, no fire and wildfires have replaced it. What we are not seeing is cultural fire for country and the right fire for country. The right fire for koala country is maintaining the health of the ecosystem. That includes protecting the canopy where the koalas live. Regenerating the tree that they eat. When you practise fire the right way, it helps to reduce or stop the wildfires. They will still come but are not as bad as the wildfires we are seeing. If you burn the right way you will also get the next generations of food, habitat and trees. Fires are a critical part of koala country. There is no doubt that climate change is making these fires worse. No matter how we manage it, there would be a lot of fire in the landscape because there is a drying process and we are dealing with the effects of climate change. Our people managed the landscapes through changing climates for millennia but the degree of climate change we are seeing now is unprecedented. Yet we can apply cultural knowledge and lore to this problem too. The knowledge is based on reading country – seasonal indicators and cues, and being able to adapt to the change and transition. We are not talking about removing wildfire from the landscape. Wildfire is not a good term for me. A lot of the unplanned fires that happen in a landscape are lightning strikes which have their place in our lore. If this country awakens to the need for a cultural fire regime – a mosaic across tenure, across the landscape, that actually has successional burning, every year, we are out there for months and months, young and old people out there burning country, walking their pathways, learning their stories, managing that land – when these fires happen, and they are going to keep happening, the behaviour of the fire will be far different to what we are witnessing now. I would like to acknowledge all the people that helped shape my journey – too many to list here – but I would like to particularly thank my family and community for supporting me on this journey. My partner, Layla, kids, Jali and Araluen, support me to live this journey every day. My mother and her husbands, in particular Billy Yalawanga, for sharing his vision and introducing me to cultural fire. My journey would not have been possible without Victor Steffensen and Peta Marie Standley, supported by Dr Musgrave and Dr George, Kuku Thaypan elders who shared their stories to help drive the knowledge and practice along the east coast.

I always seek to acknowledge country and serve her lore.</p> <p>Country is our mother, she provides everything.

      "body": "<p>Hundreds of Amazon employees defied corporate policy to publicly criticize the company for failing to meet its “moral responsibility” in the climate crisis.</p> <p>More than 340 tech workers at Amazon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AMZNforClimate/status/1221842637168074752\">us</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AMZNforClimate/status/1221842637168074752\">ed the hashtag</a> #AMZNSpeakOut in public statements that condemn the company for not taking sufficient action on the climate crisis.</p> <p>The action comes in direct opposition to an Amazon policy barring employees from speaking about the company’s business without prior approval from management. That policy was introduced after employees vowed to participate in the global climate strikes of September 2019.</p> <p>“Every person who shared a statement had to decide for themselves that whatever the consequences, they needed to stand up for what they felt was right,” Victoria Liang, a software development engineer at Amazon who joined the public action, said. “The climate crisis is just that urgent. We just couldn’t be silenced by these policies on issues of such moral weight.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/02/amazon-threatened-fire-employees-speaking-out-climate-change-workers-say\">Amazon threatened to fire employees for speaking out on climate, workers say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Employees at Amazon have increasingly criticized the company in recent years for its contracts with large oil and gas firms. In spring 2019, more than 8,700 employees signed an open letter to the CEO, Jeff Bezos, urging him to take bolder action on climate change. The presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have also offered support of employees for speaking out.</p> <p>The employee activism is part of a broader trend in the tech industry of employee walkouts and protests against corporate policies. Google workers staged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/01/google-walkout-workers-global-protest-silicon-valley-headquarters\">internal protests</a> over sexual harassment policies in 2018 that continued into 2019 and gig workers at <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmj938/instacart-customers-and-workers-are-revolting-against-the-app\">Instacart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/08/uber-drivers-strike-over-pay-and-conditions\">Uber</a> have organized strikes to fight for better pay and benefits. In June 2019, workers at the online furnishings retailer Wayfair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/26/wayfair-employees-rally-to-protest-furniture-sales-to-migrant-facilities\">walked </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/26/wayfair-employees-rally-to-protest-furniture-sales-to-migrant-facilities\">off the job</a> to oppose the company’s contracts with detention centers for immigrants.</p> <p>An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was aware of the employee actions. She added that the external communication policy had been updated in spring 2019 but was not directed at any one group of employees. Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon by 2040 and 100% renewable energy by 2030.</p> <p>“While all employees are welcome to engage constructively with any of the many teams inside Amazon that work on sustainability and other topics, we do enforce our external communications policy and will not allow employees to publicly disparage or misrepresent the company or the hard work of their colleagues who are developing solutions to these hard problems,” she said.</p> <p>In January, at least three employees said they were threatened with termination for speaking publicly about environmental issues, stoking further protests against the new policy.</p> <p>“I’m proud to work at Amazon, but policies that silence employees who are challenging us to do better runs counter to our own leadership principles,” said Nolan Woodle, an associate contracts manager at Amazon. “When there is an issue of such importance, we have to be able to talk about it. Silencing employees is simply not the right approach.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, other companies appear to be responding to employee unrest. In January 2020, Microsoft announced it would be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20874081/microsoft-employees-climate-change-letter-protest\">a number of global actions</a> orchestrated by employees.</p> <p>Amazon’s big tech counterpart Google also appears to be making public responses to the organizing.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of Amazon employees defied corporate policy to publicly criticize the company for failing to meet its “moral responsibility” in the climate crisis. More than 340 tech workers at Amazon used the hashtag #AMZNSpeakOut in public statements that condemn the company for not taking sufficient action on the climate crisis. The action comes in direct opposition to an Amazon policy barring employees from speaking about the company’s business without prior approval from management. That policy was introduced after employees vowed to participate in the global climate strikes of September 2019. “Every person who shared a statement had to decide for themselves that whatever the consequences, they needed to stand up for what they felt was right,” Victoria Liang, a software development engineer at Amazon who joined the public action, said. “The climate crisis is just that urgent. We just couldn’t be silenced by these policies on issues of such moral weight.” Employees at Amazon have increasingly criticized the company in recent years for its contracts with large oil and gas firms. In spring 2019, more than 8,700 employees signed an open letter to the CEO, Jeff Bezos, urging him to take bolder action on climate change. The presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have also offered support of employees for speaking out. The employee activism is part of a broader trend in the tech industry of employee walkouts and protests against corporate policies. Google workers staged internal protests over sexual harassment policies in 2018 that continued into 2019 and gig workers at Instacart and Uber have organized strikes to fight for better pay and benefits. In June 2019, workers at the online furnishings retailer Wayfair walked off the job to oppose the company’s contracts with detention centers for immigrants. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was aware of the employee actions. She added that the external communication policy had been updated in spring 2019 but was not directed at any one group of employees. Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon by 2040 and 100% renewable energy by 2030. “While all employees are welcome to engage constructively with any of the many teams inside Amazon that work on sustainability and other topics, we do enforce our external communications policy and will not allow employees to publicly disparage or misrepresent the company or the hard work of their colleagues who are developing solutions to these hard problems,” she said. In January, at least three employees said they were threatened with termination for speaking publicly about environmental issues, stoking further protests against the new policy. “I’m proud to work at Amazon, but policies that silence employees who are challenging us to do better runs counter to our own leadership principles,” said Nolan Woodle, an associate contracts manager at Amazon. “When there is an issue of such importance, we have to be able to talk about it. Silencing employees is simply not the right approach.” Meanwhile, other companies appear to be responding to employee unrest. In January 2020, Microsoft announced it would be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade after a number of global actions orchestrated by employees. Amazon’s big tech counterpart Google also appears to be making public responses to the organizing. On the job platform LinkedIn on Monday, someone listing himself as a hiring manager at Google left a post that appeared to attempt to recruit defectors from Amazon to the company. “I recognize your courage and bravery to speak out about climate change,” he wrote, linking to a post on how Google is “working to battle climate change”.

The company did not respond to accusations that Google, too, has fired employees over organizing.",

In spring 2019, more than 8,700 employees signed an open letter to the CEO, Jeff Bezos, urging him to take bolder action on climate change. The presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have also offered support of employees for speaking out.</p> <p>The employee activism is part of a broader trend in the tech industry of employee walkouts and protests against corporate policies. Google workers staged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/01/google-walkout-workers-global-protest-silicon-valley-headquarters\">internal protests</a> over sexual harassment policies in 2018 that continued into 2019 and gig workers at <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmj938/instacart-customers-and-workers-are-revolting-against-the-app\">Instacart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/08/uber-drivers-strike-over-pay-and-conditions\">Uber</a> have organized strikes to fight for better pay and benefits. In June 2019, workers at the online furnishings retailer Wayfair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/26/wayfair-employees-rally-to-protest-furniture-sales-to-migrant-facilities\">walked </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/26/wayfair-employees-rally-to-protest-furniture-sales-to-migrant-facilities\">off the job</a> to oppose the company’s contracts with detention centers for immigrants.</p> <p>An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was aware of the employee actions. She added that the external communication policy had been updated in spring 2019 but was not directed at any one group of employees. Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon by 2040 and 100% renewable energy by 2030.</p> <p>“While all employees are welcome to engage constructively with any of the many teams inside Amazon that work on sustainability and other topics, we do enforce our external communications policy and will not allow employees to publicly disparage or misrepresent the company or the hard work of their colleagues who are developing solutions to these hard problems,” she said.</p> <p>In January, at least three employees said they were threatened with termination for speaking publicly about environmental issues, stoking further protests against the new policy.</p> <p>“I’m proud to work at Amazon, but policies that silence employees who are challenging us to do better runs counter to our own leadership principles,” said Nolan Woodle, an associate contracts manager at Amazon. “When there is an issue of such importance, we have to be able to talk about it. Silencing employees is simply not the right approach.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, other companies appear to be responding to employee unrest. In January 2020, Microsoft announced it would be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20874081/microsoft-employees-climate-change-letter-protest\">a number of global actions</a> orchestrated by employees.</p> <p>Amazon’s big tech counterpart Google also appears to be making public responses to the organizing. On the job platform LinkedIn on Monday, someone listing himself as a hiring manager at Google <a href=\"https://twitter.com/techworkersco/status/1221947588716314624\">left a post</a> that appeared to attempt to recruit defectors from Amazon to the company.</p> <p>“I recognize your courage and bravery to speak out about climate change,” he wrote, linking to a post on how Google is “working to battle climate change”. A Google spokeswoman said the company was not aware of the post and that it was made by a recruiter acting on his own initiative. The company did not respond to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/17/google-workers-rights-coding-chrome-unions\">accusations</a> that Google, too, has fired employees over organizing.</p>",

We just couldn’t be silenced by these policies on issues of such moral weight.”\nEmployees at Amazon have increasingly criticized the company in recent years for its contracts with large oil and gas firms. In spring 2019, more than 8,700 employees signed an open letter to the CEO, Jeff Bezos, urging him to take bolder action on climate change. The presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have also offered support of employees for speaking out. The employee activism is part of a broader trend in the tech industry of employee walkouts and protests against corporate policies. Google workers staged internal protests over sexual harassment policies in 2018 that continued into 2019 and gig workers at Instacart and Uber have organized strikes to fight for better pay and benefits. In June 2019, workers at the online furnishings retailer Wayfair walked off the job to oppose the company’s contracts with detention centers for immigrants. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was aware of the employee actions. She added that the external communication policy had been updated in spring 2019 but was not directed at any one group of employees. Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon by 2040 and 100% renewable energy by 2030. “While all employees are welcome to engage constructively with any of the many teams inside Amazon that work on sustainability and other topics, we do enforce our external communications policy and will not allow employees to publicly disparage or misrepresent the company or the hard work of their colleagues who are developing solutions to these hard problems,” she said. In January, at least three employees said they were threatened with termination for speaking publicly about environmental issues, stoking further protests against the new policy. “I’m proud to work at Amazon, but policies that silence employees who are challenging us to do better runs counter to our own leadership principles,” said Nolan Woodle, an associate contracts manager at Amazon. “When there is an issue of such importance, we have to be able to talk about it. Silencing employees is simply not the right approach.” Meanwhile, other companies appear to be responding to employee unrest. In January 2020, Microsoft announced it would be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade after a number of global actions orchestrated by employees. Amazon’s big tech counterpart Google also appears to be making public responses to the organizing. On the job platform LinkedIn on Monday, someone listing himself as a hiring manager at Google left a post that appeared to attempt to recruit defectors from Amazon to the company. “I recognize your courage and bravery to speak out about climate change,” he wrote, linking to a post on how Google is “working to battle climate change”. A Google spokeswoman said the company was not aware of the post and that it was made by a recruiter acting on his own initiative. The company did not respond to accusations that Google, too, has fired employees over organizing.",

A report by the company found that Britain needs to fill 120,000 roles in the green energy industry by 2030 to help develop projects that can cut greenhouse gas emissions to near zero. That number is likely to reach 400,000 by 2050, when the government expects to have developed a clean energy system based on renewable electricity, green heating systems and electric vehicles. The growing need for new recruits to power the UK’s climate targets is expected to emerge as Britain faces a green energy jobs crunch over the next 10 years. The report warned that a fifth of employees in the energy sector are due to retire by 2030. The UK’s energy industry faces stiff competition from other sectors and has a narrow pipeline of young people pursuing Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) qualifications to draw from, it said. Nicola Shaw, the executive director of National Grid, said: “The time is now for the sector to rise to the challenge and overcome the longstanding issues we face in recruiting a diverse workforce with the right skills to deliver on the UK’s ambitions.” The UK’s plan to cut emissions to virtually zero, and offset unavoidable pollution through carbon capture schemes, will require major investments in offshore wind, clean heating schemes, electric vehicles and carbon-capture technology. The energy industry is expected to use its role in tackling the global climate crisis to encourage young graduates into the industry. Research carried out by YouGov has found that people of all ages, from all regions across the UK, are “looking for a job with environmental purpose”. More than eight in 10 women and seven in 10 men have said they are keen to play their part in tackling climate change. Over half of adults are specifically looking to work for an organisation that is helping the UK to achieve its climate goals. The rising need for green energy jobs could bring opportunities for skilled tradespeople, engineers and other specialists “across every region of the country”, the report said. A quarter of the green jobs required will need to be based in the north of the country, according to National Grid. It estimated that more than 21,000 new recruits will be needed to complete energy projects, including an offshore wind farm off the coast of Blyth and the new subsea power cable to Norway from the north-east of England. Meanwhile, the development of carbon capture and storage in the Yorkshire and Humber region is expected to support 17,000 new jobs. Another 28,000 roles will be needed to work on more offshore wind farms off the east of England.

          "bodyTextSummary": "The UK must recruit more than 100,000 people to fill green energy roles within a decade if the government hopes to meet its binding climate targets, National Grid has warned. A report by the company found that Britain needs to fill 120,000 roles in the green energy industry by 2030 to help develop projects that can cut greenhouse gas emissions to near zero. That number is likely to reach 400,000 by 2050, when the government expects to have developed a clean energy system based on renewable electricity, green heating systems and electric vehicles. The growing need for new recruits to power the UK’s climate targets is expected to emerge as Britain faces a green energy jobs crunch over the next 10 years.\nThe report warned that a fifth of employees in the energy sector are due to retire by 2030. The UK’s energy industry faces stiff competition from other sectors and has a narrow pipeline of young people pursuing Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) qualifications to draw from, it said. Nicola Shaw, the executive director of National Grid, said: “The time is now for the sector to rise to the challenge and overcome the longstanding issues we face in recruiting a diverse workforce with the right skills to deliver on the UK’s ambitions.” The UK’s plan to cut emissions to virtually zero, and offset unavoidable pollution through carbon capture schemes, will require major investments in offshore wind, clean heating schemes, electric vehicles and carbon-capture technology. The energy industry is expected to use its role in tackling the global climate crisis to encourage young graduates into the industry. Research carried out by YouGov has found that people of all ages, from all regions across the UK, are “looking for a job with environmental purpose”. More than eight in 10 women and seven in 10 men have said they are keen to play their part in tackling climate change. Over half of adults are specifically looking to work for an organisation that is helping the UK to achieve its climate goals. The rising need for green energy jobs could bring opportunities for skilled tradespeople, engineers and other specialists “across every region of the country”, the report said. A quarter of the green jobs required will need to be based in the north of the country, according to National Grid. It estimated that more than 21,000 new recruits will be needed to complete energy projects, including an offshore wind farm off the coast of Blyth and the new subsea power cable to Norway from the north-east of England.\nMeanwhile, the development of carbon capture and storage in the Yorkshire and Humber region is expected to support 17,000 new jobs. Another 28,000 roles will be needed to work on more offshore wind farms off the east of England. In Scotland, green energy workers will be needed to fill more than 48,000 jobs by 2050, with a further 25,000 roles expected in Wales. Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister of state for business, energy and clean growth, said: “Tackling climate change is not only saving the planet, but is significantly boosting our economy.

He said: “[It shows] that if growers are willing to adapt by changing the varieties they grow, there are ways to maintain yields in the face of rising temperatures, at least in the less extreme emissions scenarios. “The challenge for the industry will be that local varieties often add distinctive characters to wines, and there will be a reluctance to let go of traditional varieties, especially in areas with strong cultural heritage. Can you imagine a burgundy without a pinot noir grape, for instance?”.",

But the warning … is we should limit warming [as much as] possible, because the more warming we have, the fewer options for adaptation.”</p> \n<p>Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Morales-Castilla and colleagues report how they built a computer model that takes into account the timing of processes such as budding and fruit ripening for the 11 different varieties, as well as the climate in areas where these varieties are currently grown. From this, they identified areas within current wine-growing regions suitable for each of the 11 varieties.</p>"

                "html": "<p>The model suggests global heating may hit the wine cellar hard: if no action is taken, a 2C rise would result in a 56% loss in land for the 11 varieties . A 4C rise would mean 85% of these areas would be lost.</p> \n<p>While Morales-Castilla said that was partly down to factors such as changes in rainfall, the main driver was heat. He noted this might damage plants, or speed up ripening and make the grapes too high in sugar.</p> \n<p>But the model also shows that if these areas could be replanted with a more suitable wine grape, or newly suitable areas planted, only 24% of growing area within current regions would be lost under a 2C temperature rise – a reduction in loss of more than a half. Under a 4C rise, 58% of such an area would be lost if varieties were switched or newly suitable areas planted – about a third lower than if no such action was taken.</p> \n<p>For example, many areas of wine land suitable for pinot noir, including in South Africa and Burgundy, will need to be switched to grapes such as syrah, monastrell and grenache, which produce fruit later in the year and are better able to tolerate a warmer climate.</p> \n<p>The team said some countries might be more affected than others, with countries already warmer and less able to compensate for future losses: land loss for the varieties could hit 90% for Italy and Spain under 4C of heating.</p> \n<p>And there’s more: the team found that new areas around the world – including parts of the UK – would become suitable for wine grapes as the planet continues to heat, with early-ripening varieties such as pinot noir moving north.</p> \n<p>The study has limitations, including the fact that it only looks at a handful of the more than 1,100 varieties of wine grape. Morales-Castilla suggested other varieties might offer greater potential for adaptation as the climate continued to heat up.</p> \n<p>The team said mitigation efforts were not without their problems: replanting or regrafting vineyards is expensive. There are also complex rules about how wines are labelled: for example, the name “champagne” can legally be used only if the sparkling wine comes from the Champagne region of France.</p> \n<p>Prof Steven Penfield, of the crop genetics department at the John Innes Centre, who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study. He said: “[It shows] that if growers are willing to adapt by changing the varieties they grow, there are ways to maintain yields in the face of rising temperatures, at least in the less extreme emissions scenarios.</p> \n<p>“The challenge for the industry will be that local varieties often add distinctive characters to wines, and there will be a reluctance to let go of traditional varieties, especially in areas with strong cultural heritage. Can you imagine a burgundy without a pinot noir grape, for instance?”.</p>"

          "bodyTextSummary": "Is the Guardian really arguing that leaders who don’t jet into Davos aren’t committed to poverty reduction and climate action (World Bank chief’s Davos snub dashes hopes of climate consensus, 23 January)? The World Bank Group (WBG) is taking concerted action to tackle global poverty and boost shared prosperity by delivering concrete results for the world’s poorest and most marginalised people, including broad-based and sustainable growth, jobs, debt transparency, rule of law, good governance, human capital and green financing. In his first year, the WBG president, David Malpass, has met more than 100 leaders around the developing world, in countries from Pakistan and Egypt to Ethiopia and Mozambique. Our strong focus on country results is one reason why the World Bank has repeatedly been given the highest rating among international agencies in the UK Department for International Development’s reviews of multilateral development partners. The WBG is committed to climate action and provides by far the most climate-related finance among multilateral development banks and other international organisations, almost half of the total. In the last fiscal year alone, the WBG committed $17.8bn (£13.6bn) to climate-related investments – and we announced $200bn of climate finance over the period 2021-25. The World Bank Group and our leadership remain focused on the urgent and significant challenges facing more than 700 million people living on less than $1.90 a day.
